# 1D-heat-conduction-problem
Finite Difference Method example.
Problem statement-
Using Finite Difference menthod find out temperature difference in a rod with one end heated to maintain 100 deg celsius.However,other end
of the rod is exposed to air at 15 deg celsius.The value of heat transfer coefficient is -2W/m^2K. The rod material is steel with thermal 
conductivity 60W/mK. The length of the rod is 2 meter. Consider 20 nodes.
